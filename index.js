// Pieces move from the nest to the colored starting space to the left of the nest, per rules in the following section.
  //to move onto the track you need to roll a combo of '5'. This can be a singular die, or as a combo. If you roll a 5 on one die, but not on the other, you will use the second die to move a piece that has entered play, including the piece just entered. If you roll two 5s, move two pieces from your 'starting point' if present

  //once a piece is on the board, the roll of the die determines how many spaces the pieces move. Die may be combined to move one piece, or may be used separately to move separate pieces, but you may not split a singular die into two moves. 

  // moving pieces into play from the 'starting point' takes precedence over moving pieces around the board. If you throw a '5' and you have pieces on your starting point,' you must enter those pieces into play. if your blue space is blocakaded, and you have a piece that must ber netered into play, you lose your turn. 

// all blue spaces are safe spaces (unless your opponent currently occupies it)

//if you are able to stop the movement of your piece by exact count on a cream space that your opponent is on, you have captured that piece. That opponent's piece is returned to your opponent's nest.

//you may never move your pieces onto an opponents red path, which belongs to each nest directly to the left of your starting point. 

  //if you throw doubles, you immediately take another turn

  //Parcheesi rules specifiy, two pieces of the same color that have stopped (by exact count) on the same space (cream or blue, including your ‘starting space’) form a blockade. No pieces may pass this blockade, including your own. You must move spaces equal to the die roll on each turn, if able. You can leave a blockade in place until you cannot move any other pieces, but you must break the blockade if you have no other moves.

  //A piece only enters the ‘Home’ square by exact count. If you are 2 spaces from the ‘Home’ square and roll a 4 and 5, you cannot move that piece.
  //to win the game, be the first to move all your pieces to the center ‘Home’ square.
